<p>Simply put, without our generous sponsors, WordCamp Buffalo would not be affordable to the vast majority of the WordPress community. For just $25 our attendees have a full day to gain insight from our speakers, network with others, and learn more about the open source WordPress project whose mission is to democratize publishing through Open Source, GPL software. All of our valued sponsors, by donating to WordCamp Buffalo, continue to make this mission a reality. Thank you both to our sponsors, and all of those who sponsor WordCamps around the world!</p>
