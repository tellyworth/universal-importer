<p>Every day, I get to fuel my passion for helping others succeed in what they love — that’s the heart of my work at <a href="https://canimarketinggroup.com" rel="nofollow">CANI Marketing Group</a> and beyond.</p>

<p>With over 20 years of experience in business operations, management, marketing, and tech, I’ve been the go-to guy for helping companies scale. I’ve seen firsthand the highs and lows of guiding a business through growth spurts and tricky markets. In 2013, I founded CANI Marketing Group so I could use those insights and learned experiences to help others grow their business.</p>

<p>But it’s not all about the bottom line. I’ve always believed in giving back. Whether it’s working with non-profits, rolling up my sleeves for community projects, or mentoring startups, making a real difference is what keeps me going. There’s something special about being part of someone’s dream from the ground up — it’s a ride like no other.</p>

<p>What’s in my toolkit? Quite a mix – from Adobe Creative Suite to Google Analytics, WordPress (of course) and everything in-between. Whether it’s crafting a digital strategy or diving into data, I love mixing tech and marketing to find those game-changing solutions.</p>

<p>At CANI Marketing Group, we talk a lot about being part of a team — and I really mean it. Around here we say ‘we’ and ‘our’ when talking about our clients’ businesses because their wins are our wins. Let’s make things happen together.</p>
